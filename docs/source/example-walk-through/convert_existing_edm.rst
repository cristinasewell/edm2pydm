Convert an Existing EDM Screen to a PyDM Screen
===============================================

In this section we will go over an existing EDM screen and try to convert it to a PyDM screen.

.. note::

	There are multiple ways one can go about designing a screen in PyDM, therefore in this Walk-through we will merely cover a certain approach but please be aware that there could be other approaches that are better or simply more convenient for you.
	
Let's start with the screen that we want to convert:

.. figure:: /_static/example-walk-through/edm/screen.PNG
   :scale: 100 %
   :width: 600pt
   :align: center
   

The first steps we want to take when converting an EDM screen, is to go in ``Edit`` mode and inspect what types of widgets we will be dealing with, so that we know what widgets we should be using in PyDM.
To do this, middle click on the EDM screen and select Edit â€“ see highlighted in blue below:
