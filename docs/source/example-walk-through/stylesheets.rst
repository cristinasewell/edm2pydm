More about Stylesheets
**********************
As mentioned priviously, besides changing the stylesheet for individual widgets, we could create a ``.qss`` file with desired stylesheet properties and this can be applied for the entire screen.

There are many examples and a great amount of information online about different styles for different widgets. Whenever you want to change a style of a widget, you can simply search for **QT Stylesheet for ... PushButton** for example and you can copy and paste those styles thay you find online into your own ``.qss`` file. 
There are also free downloadable ``.qss`` files that others have created, with different themes.

.. note::
    You can download the ``.qss`` file that we developed in this walk-through from :download:`this link </_static/example-walk-through/my_style.qss>`
